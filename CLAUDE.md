# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**LabLoop Backend (`labloop-be`)** - Backend service for the LabLoop digital health ecosystem.

This is a fresh repository that appears to be part of a larger LabLoop digital health platform. The backend service is likely intended to provide API endpoints and business logic for lab management and health data processing.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized repository with minimal structure. The codebase will need fundamental setup including:

- Technology stack selection (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring, etc.)
- Database configuration and models
- API endpoint structure
- Authentication and authorization
- Development and deployment configurations

## Development Setup

Since this is a fresh repository, initial development will require:

1. **Technology Stack Decision**: Choose the appropriate backend framework
2. **Database Setup**: Configure database connections and schemas
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables and configuration files
4. **Development Tooling**: Configure linting, testing, and build processes
5. **API Design**: Define endpoint structure and data models

## Architecture Considerations

As part of the LabLoop ecosystem, this backend service should consider:

- **Integration Points**: How this service connects with other LabLoop components
- **Data Models**: Core entities like patients, lab results, reports, and cases
- **Security Requirements**: Healthcare data compliance (HIPAA, etc.)
- **Scalability**: Design for handling lab data processing loads
- **API Design**: RESTful or GraphQL API patterns for frontend integration

## Next Steps for Development

1. Initialize the chosen technology stack with appropriate project structure
2. Set up database connections and basic models
3. Implement core API endpoints
4. Add authentication and authorization layers
5. Configure development, testing, and deployment environments
6. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific commands and architecture details

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the codebase evolves to include:
- Specific build, test, and development commands
- Detailed architecture and code organization patterns
- Database schema and model relationships
- API endpoint documentation
- Environment setup requirements
